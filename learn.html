                    <h2>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)</h2>
                    <p>FCFS schedules processes in the order they arrive. Simple and fair, but longer processes can delay shorter ones, leading to inefficiency.</p>
                    <h3>Pros:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simple and easy to implement.</li>
                        <li>Fair to processes in terms of arrival order.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Cons:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can lead to long waiting times due to the "convoy effect" where longer processes delay others.</li>
                        <li>Inefficient for systems with varied process sizes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>How It Works in Gantt Chart:</h3>
                    <p>Processes are placed on the Gantt chart in the order of arrival, with each process running until completion before the next begins. For example, if Process A arrives before Process B, A completes before B starts, even if B has a shorter burst time.</p>

                    <h2>Shortest Job First (SJF)</h2>
                    <p>SJF schedules processes based on the shortest burst time, reducing waiting time. However, it can lead to starvation if longer processes keep waiting.</p>
                    <h3>Pros:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Minimizes average waiting time for processes.</li>
                        <li>Enhances overall system efficiency.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Cons:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>May cause starvation for longer processes.</li>
                        <li>Requires prior knowledge of burst times, which is often difficult.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>How It Works in Gantt Chart:</h3>
                    <p>Processes are arranged in the Gantt chart in ascending order of burst times. For instance, if Process A has a burst time of 5 and Process B has 3, B will be scheduled first, reducing average waiting time.</p>

                    <h2>Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)</h2>
                    <p>SRTF is a preemptive version of SJF, where the process with the shortest remaining time is executed. New processes with a shorter burst time can interrupt ongoing ones.</p>
                    <h3>Pros:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Minimizes average waiting time further than SJF.</li>
                        <li>Ideal for systems requiring real-time responses.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Cons:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Complex to implement with frequent preemptions.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>How It Works in Gantt Chart:</h3>
                    <p>Each process on the Gantt chart starts based on the shortest remaining time. If Process A is executing and Process B arrives with a shorter remaining time, A is preempted, and B starts. This leads to frequent context switches.</p>

                    <h2>Round Robin (RR)</h2>
                    <p>RR assigns each process a fixed time slice (quantum). Processes are cycled in a circular order, moving to the back of the queue if they’re not completed within their quantum, ensuring fair CPU access.</p>
                    <h3>Pros:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fair, as each process gets an equal time slice.</li>
                        <li>Responsive, especially useful for interactive systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Cons:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can lead to high turnaround time if the quantum is too small.</li>
                        <li>High context switching overhead if the quantum is too short.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>How It Works in Gantt Chart:</h3>
                    <p>Each process appears on the Gantt chart for the duration of the quantum. If it completes within the time, it finishes; otherwise, it returns to the queue, and the next process gets a turn. The Gantt chart will display each process in sequence, repeating until they all finish.</p>

                    <h2>Priority Scheduling (PS)</h2>
                    <p>PS schedules processes based on priority levels. Processes with higher priority are executed first, and if a higher-priority process arrives, it can preempt the current one.</p>
                    <h3>Pros:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Efficient for prioritizing critical tasks.</li>
                        <li>Allows for high customization with aging to prevent starvation.</li>

                    <p>Processes are arranged on the Gantt chart based on priority. If Process B has a higher priority than Process A, B is executed first. If a higher-priority process arrives while a lower-priority one is running, the chart will update to reflect this preemption.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>Cons:</h3>

                    <p>The Gantt chart segments each queue, scheduling all processes in a higher-priority queue before moving to the next. Each queue’s policy determines its processes’ order in the chart.</p>
